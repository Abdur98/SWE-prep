# TopSort
# A topological sort takes a directed acyclic graph and produces a linear ordering of all its vertices such that if the graph G contains an edge
# (ùë£,ùë§), then the vertex ùë£ comes before the vertex ùë§ in the ordering.

# Algorithm
# Call dfs(g) for some graph g. The main reason we want to call depth first search is to compute the finish times for each of the vertices. (paranthesis property: all child have later discovery and earlier finish)
# Store the vertices in a list in decreasing order of finish time.
# Return the ordered list as the result of the topological sort.

    We can now describe the algorithm to compute the strongly connected components for a graph.

# Strongly connected components (SCC)
# Call dfs for the graph ùê∫ to compute the finish times for each vertex.
# Compute ùê∫^t (i.e. if G has path (u, v), G^t has path (v, u))
# Call dfs for the graph ùê∫^t but in the main loop of DFS explore each vertex in decreasing order of finish time.
# Each tree in the forest computed in step 3 is a strongly connected component. Output the vertex ids for each vertex in each tree in the forest to identify the component.

# Dijkstra's algorithm (O(V)log(v) for constructing heap & O(E)Log(V) for runtime so O((E+V)log(v))) overall
# BFS for shortest path but with weighted edges
# only works when weights all +ve
